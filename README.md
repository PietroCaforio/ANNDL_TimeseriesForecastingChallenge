# ANNDL_TimeseriesForecastingChallenge
Repo containing the results of the challenge2 of the course Artificial Neural Network and Deep Learning @ Politecnico di Milano, in which my team and I ranked 5th over more than 150 teams and 600 partecipants. Pinguino!

The task was to forecast timeseries of various types. Lots of fun!
